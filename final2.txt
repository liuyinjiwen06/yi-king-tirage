    "meaning": "With water and fire in their appropriate positions, yin and yang in harmony, it is the ideal state. The upper trigram of Kan represents water, the lower trigram of Li represents fire, water and fire harmoniously intermingle, balancing yin and yang. However, water tends to flow downward while fire rises upward, and this harmonious state is not eternal. Observing this symbol, the superior man understands: in the moment of utmost completion, one should remain alert and be prepared for dangers ahead."

    "overview": "Hexagram Wei Ji is the last hexagram in the I Ching, symbolizing a state of incompleteness. Like fire over water, with the disorder of yin and yang, it appears chaotic but holds great potential for transformation. Wei Ji signifies not an end but a new beginning, brimming with infinite possibilities.",

Fire naturally rises while in the upper position, and water naturally descends while in the lower position, each following its own nature but failing to interact. Observing this image, the superior man understands: in a state of incompleteness, clear discrimination is required in handling matters, assessing the situation, and choosing wisely."
